# Introduction

**State of Being** is a collection of scripts and tasks designed to gather and quantify my current state and goals. üìä

At an atomic level, it monitors aspects like my sleep patterns, awareness, workouts, and meditation efficiency. On a more abstract level, it links my daily tasks [‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ](https://www.rekhtadictionary.com/meaning-of-karm#:~:text=act%2C%20deed%2C%20religious%20act%2C%20destiny) to my life's vision.
Through this project, my aim is to track and enhance personal growth in a manner akin to tracking the development of a product. üå±

The foundational principles of this system stem from the teachings of my teacher and mentor, [Dr. Amit Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dramitjain/?originalSubdomain=in). The data collection methods and interfaces draw inspiration from the works of [@AnandChoudhary](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/life)
and [Bryan Johnson](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/). üôå
